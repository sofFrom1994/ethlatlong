#Contributing

This project's implementation and lower level goals are in flux. The current state is between a prototype and the first public version. We would love to hear feedback, ideas, issues, and contributions you might have. Either through here (discussions or issues) or if you reach out directly through any of our public profiles. 

If your idea is open-ended, on very early stages or mostly theoretical, open a discussion. If you have a more specific concern, feature or implementation in mind open an issue. 
If unsure, pick either one and we'll go from there. 

After opening an issue, and assuning we are in agreement and understanding of what we would like, then open a pr. Feel free to follow these guidelines but it really doesn't need to be too formal, mostly just that, guidelines [https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/introduction/contributing#pull-request-guidelines].
